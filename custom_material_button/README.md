# custom_material_button
 
This is my first custom widget for general purpose, and I believe this guide will help new comers.

The Material Button has following features 
1. ShapeBorder
2. Splash Color
3. Icon
4. Background Color
5. TextStyle

#How to use
> Include the CustomMaterial.dart file to your lib folder and Import the file to your main.dart file and you can use the Button as follows

```dart
MButon(title: 'Click me',
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        newshape: StadiumBorder(),
        splash: Colors.green,
        background_color: Colors.orange,)
```
